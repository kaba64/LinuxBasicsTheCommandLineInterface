-std=c11 : means that the standard to be used to compile is the C version 2011.
-Wall : means that we do not want to have all warnings.
-fmax-errors=10 : means that we will have a maximum of 10 errors.
-Wextra : means that we will have extra warnings.

One role of the computer's operating system is to manage the memory of the computer.
The term memory refers to the hardware in the computer that is involved in storing information for use in the computer.
We distinguish between two different types of memory.
RAM, short for Random Access Memory, is temporary memory that is easy and quick to access and, for example, used to execute programs.
We also call this type of storage volatile memory.
On the other hand, there is nonvolatile, or lasting memory for more permanent storage of data, for example,
used to store files on the hard drive.

For simplicity, we may represent the Random Access Memory as a sequence of binary memory cells, each populated with a 0 or a 1.
We call each such cell 1 bit. By grouping several of these cells or bits together, we create what is called a word.
A word is the fundamental unit of data that can be moved between the RAM and the computer processor.
The size of a word is thus expressed in number of bits -- that is, number of memory cells -- or in bytes.

Modern personal computers and modern processors more ordinarily tend to use 8, 16, 32,
or even 64 bits to form one word, though other word sizes are possible.

Well, this allows for the addressing of memory. In fact, an address is assigned to each word. We also call this a memory address.
The computer address is a whole number that describes the location of the word in the computer memory.
